  abstract = {We have performed an empirical study of various deterministic bayesian
	networks structure learning algorithms. The first test step has allowed
	us to emphasise which learning technics need a specific initialisation
	et we have proposed a way to do this. In the second stage of this
	doctoral study, we have adapted some learning technics to incomplete
	datasets. Then, we have proposed an efficient algorithm to learn
	a tree augmented naive bayes classifier in a general way from an
	incomplete dataset. We also have introduce a original formalism to
	modelise incomplete dataset generation processes with MCAR or MAR
	assumptions. Finaly, various synthetic datasets and real datasets
